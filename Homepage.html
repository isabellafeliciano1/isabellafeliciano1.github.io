        <h2>What I did for the past two months!</h2>

        <p>My name is Isabella Feliciano and words friends and family use to describe me are loyal, reliable, and responsible. I work at an ice 
            cream shop in Dover, Pennsylvaniaand am about to pick up a second job at a movie theater in Dover, Pennsylvania as well. I like 
            to play video games on my free time and love to spend time with my friends and family. In school, I have been working on a game 
            using a format called RPG maker, I have also been learning how to make websites using HTML.</p>
