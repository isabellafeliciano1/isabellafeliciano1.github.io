        <h2>My Plans</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a 1oth grader in highschool, I go to York County School of Technology for the programming
            clases. I already have an internship set
            and ready for me at a company in Tampa, Flordia where they do cybersecurity, software, and programming, all
            using python and java script.
            My aunt Is the one who got me the internship. I do not know where exacly I want to go to college right now
            but I do plan on attending straight after I get out
            of highschool.</p>

        <p>I have always been intrested in gaming consoles and programming languages. When I was around eight years old
            my brother introduced me to a game called Dead by Daylight and that was my first ever video game I played, my second was Minecraft. 
            After three years of using my brothers Xbox One S I finally got my own for christmas that my mom payed for, my two brothers were 
            at my house when I opened it. I was so exstatic that my brother helped me set it up right away. After that, I've been intrested in 
            anything that has to do with electronics.</p>
            
            <p>I am saving up money for a car with my paychecks. After that, I am putting $100 a week in my savings account
            and am going to start tracking my money a
            starter apartment for when I graduate so I can move out and live on my own.</p>
